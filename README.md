# BetterGR Microservices Setup

##1. Go Version Consistency
  for each ms in go.mod:
  '''bash
  go 1.24.0
'''
  in Dockerfile:
  '''bash
  FROM golang:1.24-alpine AS base
'''
##2. Environment Variable Loading in server.go:
Update all server.go files in the microservices to safely load the .env file without failing if it‚Äôs missing.
Replace this code:
'''bash
err := godotenv.Load()
if err != nil {
	klog.Fatalf("Error loading .env file")
}
'''
with this code:
'''bash
if err := godotenv.Load(); err != nil {
	klog.Warning("Warning: No .env file loaded, proceeding with environment variables only")
}
'''
